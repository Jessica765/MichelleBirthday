            <p>
                I was going to just do the usual and write a message to you through WhatsApp or on Facebook, but then I decided that I have to do something a bit more special. Because you are special!

                When I was looking for some photos to use for this project, I paged through the album that we have at home (<em>it was actually in the garage but nevertheless</em>). I found some of the cutest photos that Dad has of you and I picked out a bunch of my favorites, but that ended up being over twenty photos and I didn’t know if I had enough to say to fit with all of them.

            <p>
                I can’t believe that it’s your 40<sup>th</sup> birthday! It seems that it wasn’t long ago that you came back from the UK and celebrated your 30<sup>th</sup>! I hope that when you look back on the past ten years, that you think that they have been some of the best years of your life - you met an amazing guy, got married, bought two houses (and sold one of them) and had the most adorable little girl! I hope that the next ten years bring you as much joy as the past ten!

                Happy birthday my beautiful sister! I wish you eternal happiness and brilliant success in everything you do! I hope that you have an amazing birthday and enjoy your party on Saturday, I’m sure you will get spoilt rotten! Love you a whole bunch, happy birthday!
